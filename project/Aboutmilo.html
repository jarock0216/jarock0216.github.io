			<h2>Meet Milo</h2> <!-- Subheading for Milo's introduction -->
			<p>Milo is a small, adorable Shi-Chi (a Shih Tzu and Chihuahua mix) known for his playful energy and sweet nature. At just a few pounds, he’s compact, but his personality fills the room!</p>
			<p>Milo has straight, soft fur that makes him perfect for cuddles, and he loves to give lots of kisses any chance he gets to anyone who shows him attention.</p>
			<p>Despite his small size, Milo is full of energy and loves running around, playing fetch, and exploring new places.</p>
			<p>Though he’s always energetic, he enjoys curling up on soft blankets or sitting in laps for some quality snuggle time.</p>
